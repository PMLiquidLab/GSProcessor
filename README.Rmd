# GSProcessor

GEN-RWD Sandbox Processor (**GSProcessor**) is the R package for the Processor module of the GEN-RWD Sandbox architecture[^1].

[^1]: Paper CIBB Reference

## Introduction

The Processor is the module responsible for executing analytics tasks according to a black box model that relies on a minimal structure. This structure comprises a token, an input folder, the processing unit, and an output folder.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/general.pipeline.png")
```

The Processor monitors one or more input folders, and upon the post of a token into an input folder, it processes and executes the script contained within the token (**Figure A**). The Processor then reports the result of the execution to the designated output folder in the form of a new token (**Figure** **B**).

A **token** contains the details of the task to be executed and is designed as a collection of zipped files, including at least one XML file that characterizes and describes the task run and the contents of the token itself, referred to as a descriptor. A token can contain both the data and the script file or information about their location within a local repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GSProcessor like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Launch a Processor

To instantiate a Processor create a *bckGndProcessor* object and run its *start()* function, using the following code:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}

library(GSProcessor)
library(jsonlite)
library(XML)
library(stringr)
library(zip)


objS <- bckGndProcessor(input_folder.dir = "./inputFolder/",
                        output_folder.dir = "./outputFolder/",
                        tmp_folder.dir = "./tmpFolder/",
                        sync_folder.dir = "./syncFolder/",
                        override.repeated.tUID = TRUE
)

objS$start()

```

## Execute a task

To execute a task a token must be put in the input folder of the Processor.

As an example try to drop the testToken zip file into your Processor input folder.
